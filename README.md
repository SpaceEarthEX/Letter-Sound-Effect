TTS, or text-to-speech, is the digitized audio rendering of computer text into speech. TTS software can "read" text from a document, Web page or e-Book, generating synthesized speech through a computer's speakers. Proofreading with TTS allows the author to catch awkward phrases, missing words or pacing problems.
